# AgroMonitoring

AgroMonitoring is a real-time environmental monitoring system designed for agricultural use. It collects data from IoT devices (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.), processes it through a backend, stores it in a database, and provides a web dashboard for monitoring and insights.


## üöÄ Project Setup

This project is structured as a monorepo, containing the following components:

- **simulator/** - Simulated IoT sensor data to publish MQTT and then forward to Redis.
- **redis_consumer/** - A Python service that acts as a bridge between Redis streams and the Django API.
- **backend/** - Django REST API that handles sensor data and serves it to the frontend.
- **frontend/** - React Next.js-based dashboard for visualizing the data.


### üõ† Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Django
  - PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB)

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Next.js
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
  - Chart.js (for data visualization)

- **IoT:**
  - MQTT (for message brokering)
  - Redis Streams (for real-time data processing)

- **Cloud:**
  - Docker
  - AWS (S3, ECS, Lambda) _(Future)_



## üèó Getting Started

**Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agromonitoring.git
  cd agromonitoring
  ```

### Run with Docker

Set environment variables for docker compose. Use [.env example](./.env.example) as a guide.

Run: 
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

To login in you will need to create a user in Django.

Enter the container:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it backend bash
  ```
Create admin user:
  ```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

### Run Locally

Pre-requisites:
- Python (3.12)
- Node.js
- Postgres
- MQTT
- Redis Streams


Follow the instructions to run each component:
- [Django backend](./backend/README.md)
- [Redis bridge](./redis_consumer/README.md)
- [Sensor data simulator](./simulator/README.md)
- [React frontend](./frontend/README.md)

    Log in with the Django user created with:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

**Enjoy!**
