# AgroMonitoring

AgroMonitoring is a real-time environmental monitoring system designed for agricultural use. It collects data from IoT devices (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.), processes it through a backend, stores it in a database, and provides a web dashboard for monitoring and insights.

## üöÄ Project Setup

This project is structured as a monorepo, containing the following components:

- **simulator/** - Simulated IoT sensor data to publish MQTT and then forward to Redis.
- **redis_consumer/** - A Python service that acts as a bridge between Redis streams and the Django API.
- **backend/** - Django REST API that handles sensor data and serves it to the frontend.
- **frontend/** - React Next.js-based dashboard for visualizing the data.
